# Here are your Instructions
Built the full frontend MVP with your chosen style system, colors, and sections. It’s currently frontend-only using mock data and saves inquiries to browser storage (no backend yet).

What’s live
- Pages: 
  - / — OMKARNATH landing (hero with full-width image, About, Services, Gallery carousel + lightbox, Testimonials, Pricing, CTA band, Contact form, Footer)
  - /style-guide — Interactive style guide (typography, palette, buttons)
- Design details:
  - Palette: Refined Red #B42424, Deep Gold #C7A318, Ivory #FFFAF2, Charcoal #0F0F10
  - Fonts: Playfair Display (serif) + Inter (sans)
  - Glass-morphism cards (16px blur), smooth accordion, micro-animations, distinct gold/red CTAs
  - Lucide icons, shadcn components (accordion, dialog, carousel, inputs, buttons)
- Interactions:
  - Smooth nav scroll
  - Gallery: grid carousel with lightbox (Prev/Next)
  - Contact form: validation + toasts; data stored locally as a mock
- Images:
  - Hero + 11 curated Indian wedding shots (Unsplash/Pexels placeholders; we can swap anytime)

Copy for your review
- Tagline: “Timeless Indian Wedding Stories — crafted with cinema-inspired visuals and heartfelt candid moments.”
- About blurb:
  At OMKARNATH, we believe every Indian wedding carries a universe of rituals, laughter, and unscripted emotion. We blend documentary-style storytelling with the sophistication of editorial frames—so your Haldi glow, Sangeet spark, and Pheras vows live forever in moving, cinematic detail. Trusted by couples and families across India, we deliver art you can feel—today and for generations.

What’s mocked
- Gallery, testimonials, pricing, and contact form submission (localStorage). No backend/API calls yet.

Proposed backend next
- API contracts (contracts.md), then FastAPI + MongoDB implementation using existing env:
  - POST /api/inquiries: create inquiry {name, email, phone, city, dates, events, message, created_at}
  - Optional: GET /api/inquiries (admin), POST /api/leads/track (simple)
- Frontend integrates strictly via REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL (no hardcoded URLs).

Questions (please confirm)
1) Keep the current hero image or swap from the curated list? 
2) Any edits to tagline/about tone?
3) Should I proceed to backend implementation as outlined?
4) Add a WhatsApp CTA button and Instagram link in the header/footer?

Summary: Frontend landing and style guide are live with all sections, elegant Indian-wedding visuals, and working UI interactions. Data is mocked; ready to proceed with backend build upon your confirmation.
